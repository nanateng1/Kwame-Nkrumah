    <h3>Importance of CPP in Ghana's History</h3>
    <p>
        The Convention's People Party(CPP) may in these  times be irrelevant in the sense that currently, 
        there is not a single member of parliament from the CPP. The recent past elections their vote 
        percentage has declined. <br>
        <p>
            Inspite of all these, the CPP's relevance in Ghana's history can not be overlooked. The foundations 
            laid by the founder the first president of the republic till this the day drives the country's economy. 
            Some Ghanaians have even argued that he is the best president Ghana has ever had. A big question is 
            <strong>"if the CPP gave Ghana its best president why are the struggling to fetch even 1% vote during elections?"</strong>
        </p>
        <h3>Some achievments of the CPP which till  this day palys a major role in Ghana's Economy</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Establishment of Atomic Reactor</li>
            <li>Aluminium Smelter</li>
            <li>Cocoa Processing Factories</li>
            <li>Ghana Textile Corporation</li>
